Binaries are compatible with Mac OS 9.0.4, PowerPC 601. Use SheepShaver on Mac OS X (earlier than Catalina as SheepShaver is a 32 bit application)The bin file is uncompressed, but to run on Mac OS need to set the resource fork Type as APPL. Creator can be set to anything, eg ????Set Finder Flags to 7.x and set Inited to true.The .sit file is a stuffit archive which when uncompressed will yield the binary file with both resource and data forks intact, meaning no need to use ResEdit to change resource type.
