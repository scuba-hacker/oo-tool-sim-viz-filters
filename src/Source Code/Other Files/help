Hi,Can someone help me out with a couple of problems, please?1) Why does CW8 define istrstreams and ostrstreams but not strstream objects?   eg (input_char_array is pre-defined before)   strstream input(input_char_array, 100, ios::in | ios::out)   gives the following errorError   : undefined identifier 'strstream'seek.c++ line 9   strstream input_stream(input_string, sizeof(input_string), ios::in | ios::out); 2) How do I get seekg and tellg working on istrstreams?The following code is taken from 'C++ The Complete Reference' by Herbert Schildtand gives the error below :#include <iostream.h>#include <strstream.h>main(){   char input_string[80]="abcdefghijklm";      istrstream input_stream(input_string, sizeof(input_string));         char ch;      input_stream.seekg(7);   input_stream >> ch;   cout << "Character at 7: " << ch;      return 0;}Error   : 'seekg' is not a struct/union/class memberseek.c++ line 12   input_stream.seekg(7);Seekg/tellg are surely standard ANSI member functions of all input streams?I've tried the above code on a GNU C++ compiler using my university's UNIXsystem and it worked fine. What's going on? I thought Codewarrior had theentire ANSI C++ IO library.Can anyone help? Am I just forgetting to include a header, or perhaps shouldI be using stringstream objects? (which I haven't used anywhere else in my system)Mark JonesComputer Systems Engineering - University of Warwick, UKPS I'm rushing to finish my final year project and any help would be *greatly* appreciated.
